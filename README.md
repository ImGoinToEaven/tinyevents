*TinyEvents* is a simple header-only library for C++ that provides a basic, yet powerfull, event-dispatcher system. It is designed to be easy to use and to have minimal dependencies. It is written in C++17 and has no dependencies other than the standard library.

In *TinyEvents* any type can be used as an event. The events are dispatched to listeners that are registered for a specific event type. Asynchronous (deferred) dispatching using a queue is also supported.

## Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <tinyevents/tinyevents.hpp>

struct MyEvent {
    int value;
};

int maint() {
    tinyevents::Dispatcher dispatcher;

    dispatcher.listen<MyEvent>([](const auto& event) {
        std::cout << "Received MyEvent: " << event.value << std::endl;
    });

    dispatcher.queue(MyEvent{77});
    dispatcher.dispatch(MyEvent{42});  // Prints "Received MyEvent: 42"
    dispatcher.process();              // Prints "Received MyEvent: 77"

    dispatcher.dispatch(123);          // No listener for this event, so nothing happens

    return 0;
}
```

## Getting Started

### Manual Installation
Just copy the `include/tinyevents` folder to your project and add the `include` folder to your include path. The library is header-only, so no compilation is needed.

### CMake
If you use CMake, you can use the `FetchContent` module to download the library and add it to your project. For example:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  tinyevents
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/KyrietS/tinyevents.git
  GIT_TAG        master
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(tinyevents)
target_link_libraries(${TARGET} PRIVATE tinyevents)
```

Or you can just clone this repository manually and add it as a subdirectory to your CMake project.
```cmake
add_subdirectory(tinyevents)
target_link_libraries(${TARGET} PRIVATE tinyevents)
```

Don't forget to change the `${TARGET}` to the name of your target.

## Documentation

### Listening to Events

Register a listener for a specific event type. The listener will be called when an event of the specified type is dispatched.

```cpp
template<typename Event>
void listen(const std::function<void(const Event&)>& listener)
```
* listener - A callable object that will be called when an event of type `Event` is dispatched. The object must be copyable.

##### Example
```cpp
Dispatcher dispatcher;
dispatcher.listen<int>([](const int& n){ /* ... */ });
```

### Dispatching Events

Immediately dispatch an event to all the listeners that are registered for the event type.

```cpp
template<typename Event>
void send(const Event& event)
```
* event - The event to dispatch.

##### Example
```cpp
Dispatcher dispatcher;
dispatcher.send(2137);
```

### Queueing Events

Add an event to the queue. The event will be dispatched once `process()` is called.

```cpp
template<typename Event>
void queue(const Event& event)
```
* event - The event to queue. The event will be copied and stored in the queue.

##### Example
```cpp
Dispatcher dispatcher;
dispatcher.queue(2137);
```

### Processing the Queue

Processing the queue will dispatch all the events that were queued using `queue()`. The events will be dispatched in the order they were queued.

```cpp
void process()
```

## Tests

Tests are written using Google Test. The library is fetched automatically by CMake during the configuration step of the tests.

In order to run the tests with CMake, you can use the following commands:
```
cd tests
cmake -B build
cd build
cmake --build .
ctest
```
